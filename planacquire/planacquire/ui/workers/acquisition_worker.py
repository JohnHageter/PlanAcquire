"""Script execution worker.

One-shot QObject that runs a single ScriptEngine.run() call in a background
QThread.  Constructed once and reused across script runs; abort() is safe to
call from any thread.

Thread model:
  The worker lives in a dedicated QThread.  run() is invoked via a queued
  signal from the acquisition thread; it blocks the worker thread until the
  script finishes, is aborted, or raises.

Signals emitted:
  progress(str)  — timestamped log messages from the script engine
  finished()     — script completed normally
  aborted()      — script was stopped via abort()
  error(str)     — unhandled exception in the script engine
